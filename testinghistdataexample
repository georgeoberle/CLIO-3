I started this by identifying a data source that might be useful to my final project. I opted for the using the book- 
Handbook of Learned Societies and institutions:America. Washington, D.C.â€¯:, 1908. http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.b3271504

This handbook, like most directories and sources like this, have very consistent data.
Some of the elements that migght be useful to me are 
Name
Address
History
Object
Meetings
Membership
Serial Publications
Special Publications
Distribution of Publications
Research Funds and Prizes


Also this source is out of copyright. 


The next goal is to write a constructor function to create new objects.


Then create at least five objects.


var alpine = {
  name: "American Alpine Club",
  dateFounded: 1903
  address: {
  city: "Philadelphia",
  state: "PA"
     }

var oriental = {
  name: "American Oriental Society",
  dateFounded: 1842
  address: {
  city: "New Haven",
  state: "CT"
     }
     
var aps = {
  name: "American Philosophical Society",
  dateFounded: 1743
  address: {
  city: "Philadelphia",
  state: "PA"
     }

var ans = {
  name: "Academy of Natural Sciences",
  dateFounded: 1812
  address: {
  city: "Philadelphia",
  state: "PA"
     }
var aas = {
  name: "American Antiquarian Society",
  dateFounded: 1812
  address: {
  city: "Worcester",
  state: "MA"
     }

store an arbitrary number of objects

Do something interesting

Sums total members

var aaas = {
 name: "American Association for the Advancement of Science",
 dateFounded: 1848,
 address: {
   city: "Washington",
   state: "DC" },
 publication: "American Journal of Science",
 membership: {
   Fellows: 1351,
   Members: 2963
  },
 totalMembers: function() {
   var total = 0;
   for(var category in this.membership) {
    total += this.membership[category]
   }
   return total;
 }
}
